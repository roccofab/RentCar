# RentCar
This is a simple java programs that simulates a car rental. In the code there are 3 brands of car(volkswagen, audi and fiat): the main types of cars and  fuel consumptions are stored in 3 multidimensional arrays. 
# printCars
I created printCars function to print informations about cars stored in the arrays. You enter a brand between "volkswagen, audi or fiat" and you will get the available cars of the brand you chose
and how many kilometres you can drive with 10.0 l fuel.


Then you can choose the type of car and the rent time(number of days) and the price'll depence by how many days you choose, for example:  you choose to rent audi q7 || 10.0l--30km, the prices are: 70$ - 1 Day || 1770$ - 1 Month || 9075$ - 1 Year (SUPER PRICE!!)
if you choose to rent audi q7 for 60 Days, the price 'll be: 3540$.

You can get a price reduction if you choose to rent for long term rental...
